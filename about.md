<span style="font-size: 12pt;">I am a theoretical astrophysicist. My expertise is on modelling the intriguing but complex 
astronomical objects/phenomena with numerical tools in order to better understand, observe, and sometime even predict them.  More 
than often, the work requires to carry out large scale high performance numerical computation based on physically motivated 
models. The large scale data generated by these simulations can therefore provide us invaluable physical insights on those objects.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the past few years, I am very fortunate to witness the increasingly popular Data Science drives transformational progress in astronomy (and other sciences) and industry. I find it to be extremely exciting as my research usually evolves large scale data generated from large scale numerical simulations, which demands highly efficient and high quality tools for analysis and visualization.Â  I feel very lucky to be part of this "revolutionary movement", and am looking forward to devote my career to Data Science in a broader scope in the near future.

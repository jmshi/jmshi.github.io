The newly developed ShearingBox algorithm
in <span
style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Athena++</span>
allows us to explore the properties of MRI-driven turbulence with very
high resolution (thousand cubed grid cells or even higher) .</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Athena++ is a complete re-write of the
Athena astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code into C++. Compared
to earlier versions, the Athena++ code has (1) much more flexible
coordinate and grid options including adaptive mesh refinement, (2) new
physics including general relativity, (3) significantly improved
performance and scalability, and (4) improved source code clarity and
modularity. It will soon be released to public.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img class="alignright wp-image-107 size-medium" src="http://jimingshi.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/portrait-1-296x300.jpg" alt="portrait" width="296" height="300" />I was born and had my childhood in a small town about ten miles next to the north east border between China and Russia. After elementary school, I moved with my family to Ningbo (宁波) City in south east of China, which is also my father&#8217;s hometown.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">After graduating from<a href="http://www.nbxiaoshi.net/xxgk_index.en.asp"> XiaoShi High School (效实中学)</a>, I went to <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/">Univ. of Sci. & Tech. of China (USTC)</a> in Hefei, there I first studied Space Science, and later majored in Astrophysics. I went abroad pursuing PhD degree afterwards. In <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins Univ. (JHU)</a>, I worked with Prof. <a href="http://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/julian-h-krolik/">Julian Krolik</a> in Theoretical Astrophysics. Together we did several interesting projects, such as constructing an AGN torus model with radiation pressure support, measuring the MHD turbulence levels in stratified disks using numerical simulations, and modeling accretion disks around supermassive binary black holes with 3D MHD simulations.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">I earned my PhD in September 2011 and started as a <a href="http://cips.berkeley.edu/">CIPS</a> fellow in <a href="http://astro.berkeley.edu/">astronomy department at UC Berkeley</a>. There I studied planet/planetesimal formation and protoplanetary disks with Prof. <a href="http://astro.berkeley.edu/faculty-profile/eugene-chiang">Eugene Chiang</a> and other collaborators. Since July 2014, I relocated to NJ working as a Postdoc Research Associate in <a href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/">Department of Astrophysical Sciences</a> and <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/plasmacenter/">Max-Planck-Princeton Center for Plasma Physics </a>at Princeton University. Here I study the properties of MHD turbulence numerically, and continue my research in other areas related to accretion disks as well.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the past few years, I am very fortunate to witness the increasingly popular Data Science drives transformational astronomy (and other sciences) and industry. I find it to be extremely exciting as my research usually evolves large scale data generated from large scale numerical simulations, which demands highly efficient and high quality tools for analysis and visualization.  I feel very lucky to be part of this "revolutionary movement", and am looking forward to devote my career to Data Science in a more general scope in the near future. I can best be contacted at the following email address:</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are compact and extreme luminous regions in the center of galaxies which are powered by mass accretion on to super-massive (more than one million solar mass) black holes. A torus-like dust+gas mixture surrounds and obscures the central engine and gives rise to all sorts of AGNs we observed by simply varying the view angles. But how does the obscuring torus sustain its large geometrically thickness against gravity puzzles the scientists for decades. We have propose that the radiation pressure from the reprocessed infrared emission by dust is strong enough to sustain the thick structure of the torus. We constructed an equilibrium model which includes both the radiation pressure support from dust, and also localized energy sources such as starlight<img class="size-medium wp-image-109 alignright" src="http://jimingshi.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/f2b-2-300x214.png" alt="f2b" width="300" height="214" srcset="http://jimingshi.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/f2b-2-300x214.png 300w, http://jimingshi.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/f2b-2.png 504w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> irradiation, and hard X-rays caused Compton heating which are generally expected in these systems. The model proves that infrared radiation pressure can support its structure, as shown in the distribution plots of matter density (top) and energy density (bottom).  The predicted AGN luminosities also agree well with the observations. This work therefore resolves, at least partially, the problem of how to model an AGN torus. It introduces the fundamental physics and inspires further studies, such as dynamical models carried out by others later on.  (paper link at <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...679.1018S">ADS</a> & <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1891">astro-ph</a>) </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">AGNs are compact objects residing at the heart of galaxies. Powered by accretion process of supermassive black holes, they are so luminous that they even outshines their host galaxies. The unified model of AGNs requires geometrically thick dusty tori to explain the various AGN properties as an effect of orientation. However, due to the lack of observations, the dynamics and structure of these tori remain largely unknown. One promising model which naturally explains the shape of tori comes from the radiation pressure support of the reprocessed infrared emission.The dynamics and structure of toroidal obscuration around active galactic nuclei remain uncertain and controversial. In this project, we extend earlier work on the dynamical role of infrared radiation pressure by adding the effects of two kinds of distributed heating: Compton heating due to hard X-rays from the nucleus and local starlight heating. We find numerical solutions to the axisymmetric hydrostatic equilibrium, energy balance, and photon diffusion equations including these effects. Within the regime of typical parameters, the two different sources of additional heating have very similar effects: the density profile within the torus becomes  shallower both radially and vertically, but for plausible heating rates, there is only minor change (relative to the source-free case) in the distribution of column density with solid angle. The most interesting consequence of distributed heating is that it selects out a relatively narrow range of parameters permitting an equilibrium, particularly (L/L<sub>E</sub>)/τ<span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sub>T</sub></span>. We discuss the implications of both the narrowness of the permitted range and its approximate coincidence with the range inferred from observations.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The newly developed ShearingBox algorithm in <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Athena++</span> allows us to explore the properties of MRI-driven turbulence with very high resolution (thousand cubed grid cells or even higher) .</span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Athena++ is a complete re-write of the Athena astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code into C++. Compared to earlier versions, the Athena++ code has (1) much more flexible coordinate and grid options including adaptive mesh refinement, (2) new physics including general relativity, (3) significantly improved performance and scalability, and (4) improved source code clarity and modularity. It will soon be released to public.<br /> </span>
